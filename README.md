In this repository I combine simulation and forecasting methods to real business context in two given scenarios:

## Sim1

I work for a furniture company that is having its end of year clearance sale. They are selling 3 different variations of the asset, and each asset has a fixed amount remaining in inventory. I am given historical probabilities of daily customer arrival rates and probabilities of which variations of the asset will sell. My task is to give them an estimate of when all of their inventory will be purchased with the given probabilities.

## Sim2

I work for a prescription drug company that is building a new plant to produce their new product. I am given annual demand, fixed/variable costs, etc. The new plant can operate to a range of capacities. My task is to find out which capacity will maximize expected profit.
